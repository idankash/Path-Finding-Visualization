            <h6>At its core, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points. This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action.</h6>
            <p class="pmarg">All of the algorithms on this application are adapted for a 2D grid, where movements from a node to another have a "cost" of 1.</p>

            <p class="pmarg">
                Walls are impenetrable, meaning that a path cannot cross through them. Weights, however, are not impassable. 
                They are simply more "costly" to move through. In this application, moving through a weight node has a "cost" of 10.
