# PathFinding Visualizer

I built this application because I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work, with the help of visualizing them and see how they are "thinking". I hope that you enjoy this application as much as I did.

## Algorithms

This application support the following algorithms:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A Star Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Breath-first Search(BFS)** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search(DFS)** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
